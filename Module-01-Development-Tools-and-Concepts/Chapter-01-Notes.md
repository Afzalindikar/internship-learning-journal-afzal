# Chapter 01 – Introduction to Development Tools & Internship Workflow

## Day 1 Overview
Today is the first day of the internship. The session introduced the internship
structure, learning expectations, and how GitHub will be used to document learning.

## Concepts Introduced
- Internship learning journal
- Importance of documenting learning
- Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Repository and README files
- Module-wise and chapter-wise folder structure


## Day 2 Overview

Day 2 focused on preparing the development environment required for the course. The session highlighted why most data science and backend workflows rely on Linux-based systems. The trainer explained the importance of setting up a consistent environment and introduced essential tools that will be used throughout the internship.

-Importance of environment setup before coding
-Why Linux is widely used in data science and backend roles
-Introduction to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
-Overview of development tools required for the course
-Understanding the role of Git in version control
-Basics of JSON file structure used in assignments
-Introduction to package managers and command-line tools


## Day 3 Overview

The third day was centered around installing and configuring WSL on a Windows system. The instructor demonstrated how virtualization works and guided through enabling required system features. The session also introduced basic Linux terminal usage to help navigate the file system efficiently.

-Enabling virtualization and system features
-Installing Ubuntu using WSL2
-Understanding Linux directory structure
-Using terminal commands for navigation
-Managing files between Windows and Linux
-Common installation errors and fixes

## Day 4 Overview

Day 4 focused on understanding APIs and their role in real-world systems. The trainer explained how APIs act as connectors between different services and emphasized thinking beyond individual programs to understand complete systems and workflows.

-What APIs are and why they are important
-Role of APIs in data pipelines
-Systems-level thinking in software development
-Real-world examples of API usage
-Importance of API knowledge for job readiness
-How different components communicate in a system

## Day 5 Overview

The session concentrated on building a strong foundation in Git and GitHub, which will be used consistently during the internship. The instructor explained how assignments will be submitted and evaluated using GitHub repositories. Step-by-step guidance was provided on setting up Git, creating repositories, and linking the local system to GitHub securely using SSH keys. The session also addressed common errors encountered while pushing code and how to resolve them.

-Internship workflow and assignment submission process
-Git installation and initial configuration
-Creating repositories and managing files on GitHub
-Comparing HTTPS and SSH-based cloning
-Creating SSH keys and adding them to GitHub
-Cloning repositories via SSH
-Working with local files and tracking changes
-Handling authentication and permission-related errors
-Advantages of using Linux or WSL for development
