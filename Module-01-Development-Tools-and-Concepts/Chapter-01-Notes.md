# Chapter 01 – Introduction to Development Tools & Internship Workflow

## Day 1 Overview
Today is the first day of the internship. The session introduced the internship
structure, learning expectations, and how GitHub will be used to document learning.

## Concepts Introduced
- Internship learning journal
- Importance of documenting learning
- Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Repository and README files
- Module-wise and chapter-wise folder structure

## Documentation Method
- Notes will be updated daily
- Markdown files will be used
- Changes will be committed and pushed regularly

## Day 2 Overview

Day 2 focused on preparing the development environment required for the course. The session highlighted why most data science and backend workflows rely on Linux-based systems. The trainer explained the importance of setting up a consistent environment and introduced essential tools that will be used throughout the internship.

##Topics Discussed

-Installing Ubuntu using WSL2
-Understanding Linux directory structure
-Using terminal commands for navigation
-Managing files between Windows and Linux
-Common installation errors and fixes

## Day 4 Overview

Day 4 focused on understanding APIs and their role in real-world systems. The trainer explained how APIs act as connectors between different services and emphasized thinking beyond individual programs to understand complete systems and workflows.

##Topics Discussed

-What APIs are and why they are important
-Role of APIs in data pipelines
-Systems-level thinking in software development
-Real-world examples of API usage
-Importance of API knowledge for job readiness
-How different components communicate in a system

## Day 5 Overview

The session concentrated on building a strong foundation in Git and GitHub, which will be used consistently during the internship. The instructor explained how assignments will be submitted and evaluated using GitHub repositories. Step-by-step guidance was provided on setting up Git, creating repositories, and linking the local system to GitHub securely using SSH keys. The session also addressed common errors encountered while pushing code and how to resolve them.
